IMAGE BLUR 3 
------------

This problem builds off the Image Blur #2 Assignment. 

Given an image, we want to build a method to blur the image. However, instead of only blurring images that are within 1 pixel, we want to specify how far to blur pixels that are within a [Manhattan Distance](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance) of what is specified. 

Build a method def blur(distance) that will implement a blurring of the Manhattan Distance specified.
